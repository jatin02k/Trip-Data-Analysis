# Trip Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes trip data to uncover patterns and trends based on weekdays, hours, and months. The goal is to understand when most trips occur and how different time factors impact trip frequency.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset contains timestamp-based trip records. It is processed to extract key time-related features like:
- **Year, Month, Day** 🗓️
- **Hour of the Day** ⏰
- **Weekday** 📅

## 🚀 Steps Performed
### **1️⃣ Data Loading**
- Loaded the dataset using **pandas**.
- Displayed the first few rows to understand its structure.

### **2️⃣ Data Preprocessing**
- Converted timestamps to **datetime format**.
- Extracted new columns: `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`, and `Weekday`.
- Dropped missing values to ensure data consistency.

### **3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Trip Distribution by Weekday** 📅: Used a bar plot to visualize which days had the most trips.
- **Trip Distribution by Hour** ⏰: Identified peak travel hours.
- **Trip Distribution by Month** 🗓️: Observed seasonal trends in trip frequency.

### **4️⃣ Visualizations**
- Created graphs using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to showcase trends.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- The busiest weekday for trips was Friday, while the least busy was Sunday.

- Most trips occurred between 5 PM - 7 PM, indicating peak commuting hours.

- Trips peaked in August and December, possibly due to holidays and vacations.

## ❓ Questions Answered
## ❓ Q1: Why did we remove the last few rows?
✅ Sometimes datasets include summary rows at the end, which are not useful for analysis.  
By removing them, we ensure the dataset only contains actual trip records.

## ❓ Q2: Why did we convert the 'Date' column to datetime?
✅ Converting the "Date" column to a proper datetime format allows us to extract useful time-based features like Year, Month, Day, and Hour.

## ❓ Q3: Why do we use `.dropna()`?
✅ After extracting new columns, some values may turn into `NaN` due to missing or corrupt data.  
Dropping them ensures our analysis is accurate.

## ❓ Q4: Why is it important to analyze data by hour?
✅ Understanding peak hours helps businesses manage demand, allocate resources efficiently, and optimize services.

## ❓ Q5: What can we do next with this dataset?

## 📌 Next Steps
🔹 Improve analysis with more features (e.g., trip distance).  
🔹 Perform deeper analysis with machine learning models.  
🔹 Share insights in a blog post or interactive dashboard.
